* Implement a Monte Carlo Benchmark 
in order to do so we need
    * Portfolio managing n strategies at the same time
    * strategy making n different strategies at the same time
    to fully use vectorized operation and win execution time
    we also need Datalog et DataAnalyzer to be able to handle those
    finaly the benchmark should be compute on different basis
        * best Return   5% quantile |Â mean of 5% best 
        * best Std      5% quantile |
        * best Sharp    5% quantile |
        * best skew etc ...
        
this is made to rule out the possibility that the portfolio performance is a product
of luck and truly represent an economic reality



currently Strat3 is working in modules with no mechanism to make sure all modules
are instiantiated correctly which makes the use of strat3 pretty hard for
non initiated people. This is why simplistic API is currently being developped
handling all the obscure requirement a module can have.

Issues
------

* if the strategy produce no negative return we have a segmentation fault
